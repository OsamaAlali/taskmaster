# taskmaster

> On the “Add a Task” activity, allow users to optionally select a file to attach to that task. If a user attaches a file to a task, that file should be uploaded to S3, and associated with that task.

On the Task detail activity, if there is a file that is an image associated with a particular Task, that image should be displayed within that activity. (If the file is any other type, you should display a link to it.)
